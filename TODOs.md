# TODOs
In no particular order...

- Automatic testing: [unit, property and integration tests](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/using-pulumi/testing/)
- Update quotas
- How to share project templates
- When deleting emails from email list, just delete the project related to the student and not the last project -- so project ids need to be related to a specific email, and not be monotonically increasing
- How-to guide to destroy resources
- How-to guide to import resources like projects, or refresh state/stack
- You don't have to include the code to create the resource, as the repo code will define/create it
- How to use for multiple trainings and/or exercises, using different Pulumi projects and/or stacks?
